<h2>THE COMYNS AND THE GOIN'S OF ARTHUR.</h2>

<p>It was a pleasant sight, on the <em>première</em> of <em>King Arthur</em>, to see
Mr. <span class="sc">Comyns Carr</span>, poet, <em>littérateur</em>, art-critic, theatrical
manager,
orator, journalist, dramatist, and not a few other things beside,
gravely bowing his acknowledgments as "<em>the</em> Arthur of the piece"
at the Lyceum. Beshrew me, and by my halidome, he hath done his
work with so deft and cunning a hand as to puzzle not a little those
who have their <span class="sc">Goethe</span>, their <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>, and some of the most
favourite plays of <span class="sc">William Shakspeare</span> at their fingers' ends, and
who are also more or less acquainted with Wagnerian trilogies.</p>

<p>We all know "<span class="sc">Kettle</span>
began it." Well, <span class="sc">Wagner</span>
begins this, in the
Prologue, with spirits
and water, <em>i.e.</em>, mere
spirits getting along
swimmingly in a kind
of Niebelungen lake-and-cavern
scene. Not
until the curtain rose
was any sort of attention
paid to the music,
which might have
therefore been the composition
of <span class="sc">Noakes</span>
or <span class="sc">Stokes</span>, instead of
having been exquisitely
written by King <span class="sc">Arthur
Sullivan</span>.</p>

<p>Enter <em>King Arthur
Irving</em> and <em>Merlin</em>
("Charles his friend"),
suggestive of <em>Macbeth</em>
and <em>Banquo</em>, to see Wagnerian
water-witches
in <em>The Colleen Bawn's</em>
cave. Wagnerian water-witches,
disturbed by
the approach of gentlemen,
swim away to regain,
presumably, their
bathing-machines.
Then Charles-his-friend
<em>Merlin</em> undertakes the
part of a kind of half-converted
<em>Mephistopheles</em>,
and shows the
<em>Faust-King-Arthur</em> a
"living picture" of
<em>Guinevere</em> as <em>Marguerite</em>
in a vision. After
this up comes a hand
out of the water, bearing
a magnificently
jewelled scabbard, in
which, of course, is that
blade of the very first
water, "<em>Excalibur</em>."</p>

<p><em>Arthur</em> accepts the
sword with thanks, observing
that "if necessary
he will use it to
make any cuts the piece
may require." More
chorus of water-sprites,
and end of prologue.
<em>Merlin</em>, or a spirit,
ought to have sung "<em>Voici le sabre</em>." This chance was lost.</p>

<p>The next scene is at Camelot, when in come a lot of knights in
armour, and the story begins in real earnest. Here is <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span>,
sweet and majestic as the Burne-Jonesian <em>Queen Guinevere</em>, and
here, too, is <span class="sc">Forbes-Robertson</span> as <em>Lancelot</em>, a part which he
plays
and looks to perfection. The order has been given "All wigs abandon
ye who enter here," that is as far as the male principals are concerned;
so they all "keep their hair on," and thus <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>
in armour looks more like the "Knight of the Woeful Countenance,"
or a moustachioless <em>Don Quixote</em>, than the glorious Chairman of the
Goodly Round Table Company.</p>

<p><em>Sir Lancelot</em> is compelled by "circumstances over which he has
no control" to remain behind at court, all through the selfishness of
<em>King Arthur</em> (so unlike him, too, for once!), who fancies the Round
Table will be a trifle dull when all his "blooming companions have
faded and gone," and so the unfortunate young knight has to say to
the Queen, as Mr. <span class="sc">Chevalier's</span> Coster sings to his "lidy-love,"
"<em>I'm bound to keep on lovin' yer! d'yer 'ear?</em>" and he is watched
by <em>Macbeth-Mordred</em> (Mr. <span class="sc">Frank Cooper</span>) and his be-witching
mother <em>Lady Macbeth-Morgan-le-Fay</em> (Miss <span class="sc">Genevieve Ward</span>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;"><a href="images/037-1168.png"><img src="images/037-380.png" width="380" height="488" alt="C-m-ns C-rr (rising to the occasion out of the mystic" /></a>
<p><em>C-m-ns C-rr (rising to the occasion out of the mystic
mere).</em> "Up I come with my little plot!"</p></div>

<p>In Act Two, while <em>Ellen-Guinevere</em> and girls are out a-maying in
one of the most lovely of "As You Like it" woodland scenes (with a
fool in the forest, too) ever beheld on any stage, <em>Lady Macbeth-Morgan</em>
and <em>Macbeth-Mordred</em> overhear the love-making of <em>Guinny</em>
and <em>Lancy</em>; and in Act Three these "two clever ones," as poor
<em>Affery</em> was wont to style <em>Flintwich</em> and <em>Mrs. Clennam</em>, reveal
the
truth to <em>Arthur-Othello</em>, who has taken from the hand of the
suicided <em>Ophelia-Elaine</em> (Miss <span class="sc">Lena Ashwell</span>) a note, which
assists
him in discovering the wickedness of sly <em>Sir Lancy</em> and the giddy
<em>Guinny</em>. <em>Sir Lancy</em> cries, "Strike on!" and <em>King Henry Irving
Arthur</em> is just "on strike" when he exclaims "I cannot kill thee,"
and <em>Excalibur</em>, a notably sharp blade on occasion, fails him now.
<em>Lancy</em> is banished; and takes it very quietly, going out like a
lamb. <em>King Arthur</em> and all the knights go off to the wars, leaving
<em>Guinevere</em> in charge of <em>Sir Macbeth-Mordred</em> and <em>Mrs.
Morgan-le-Fay</em>,
female professor of necromancy, table-turning-medium,
"parties attended," &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Act last <em>Guinevere</em> is imprisoned in a tower, and is made love to
by that awfully Bad Knight, <em>Sir Mordred</em>, who seizes this chance of
playing <em>Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert</em> to <em>Guinny's Rebecca</em>, only
that there is no window from which she can threaten to throw
herself: and so the wicked wooing comes to a rather tame conclusion.
In the last scene <em>Macbeth-Mordred</em>
and <em>Lady Morgan-Macbeth</em> are now King and
Queen, and poor <em>Rebecca-Guinny</em> is going
to be burnt <em>à la Juive</em>,
when the herald's challenge
is answered by a very Black Knight,
who keeps himself awfully
dark, and who
does not say, "I am
<span class="sc">Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion</span>," but lifting his
steel nose-protector
(most useful except
when the Knight has
a bad cold), reveals
"The King!" Then
comes the fight&mdash;and
ah, would that here
one of the swords could
have been poisoned,
and that <em>Mordred</em>,
after slaying <em>Arthur</em>,
should himself have
been stabbed to death
by his own weapon,
while at the same time
<em>Mrs. Morgan-le-Fay</em>
might have shouted,
"See the Queen drinks
to <em>Arthur</em>," and then
she could have drained
a poisoned cup, and so
obtained her "<em>coup de
grâce</em>."</p>

<p>But no! <span class="sc">Comyns
Carr</span> would have none
of this. The wicked
flourish. Someone said
that <em>Sir Lancelot</em> was
killed "without," but
I don't believe it. My private opinion is that the sly dog <em>Lancy</em>
sneaked out quietly, waited for <em>Guinevere</em>, and then they both went
off together, to Boulogne, or Monte Carlo maybe; that <em>Morgan-le-Fay</em>
took to walking in her sleep and washing out little sanguinary
spots on her hand; and that <em>Mordred</em> got an engagement in the
provinces to play <em>Iago</em>; while all that the audience know of <em>King
Arthur</em> is that he went off with three Queens of the Night (perhaps
signifying that he ventured on a water-party with only three sovereigns)
in a barge,&mdash;perhaps "the craft of <em>Merlin</em>" mentioned by
<span class="sc">Tennyson</span>,&mdash;to some place down the river, where he was said to be
interred, and at whose grave kept guard the well-known "Waterbury
Watch." However all this is but surmise. One thing is certain&mdash;that
<em>King Arthur</em> is still alive, very much alive, and, like Lord
<span class="sc">Arthur</span> of <em>Pantomime Rehearsal</em> fame, "going strong," at the
Lyceum, for very many Arthurian nights to come. <em>Le Roi Arthur
est mort! Vive le Roi Arthur!</em></p>

<p>Bravo, <span class="sc">Comyns</span>! Well may he say to <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, "Eh, mon,
whar's your <span class="sc">Wullie Shakspeare</span> <em>noo?</em>"</p>

<div class="poem width25">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Then, ere that last weird battle 'gainst the Lords,</p>
<p>There came on <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, sleeping, in his chair,</p>
<p>At Malwood&mdash;musing, by his own fireside,</p>
<p>After much totting up of Trade Returns,</p>
<p>And Navy Estimates&mdash;a whisper blown</p>
<p>Along a wandering wind, and in his ear</p>
<p>Went shrilling, "Hollow! hollow! Forfar! Brigg!</p>
<p>Our small majority shall pass away!</p>
<p>Farewell! There is thine Hampshire rest for thee,</p>
<p>But I am blown about a wandering wind,</p>
<p>And 'Follow! follow! follow!' day and night,</p>
<p>The fighting factions of our army cry</p>
<p>To me&mdash;their 'Leader!' And I cannot face</p>
<p>Five ways at once, and it's a beastly bore!</p>
<p>And if I could, how can I get a Bill</p>
<p>Passed by the Lords?"</p>
<p class="i14">    And <span class="sc">Arthur</span> woke, and called,</p>
<p>"Who spake? A dream! O light upon the wind,</p>
<p>Thine, <span class="sc">Gawain</span>, was the voice&mdash;are these poor 'cries'</p>
<p>Thine? Or doth that same army, growing wild,</p>
<p>Mourn, wishing it had gone along with Me?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>This heard the bold Sir <span class="sc">Bedivere</span>, and spake:</p>
<p>"O me, my Chief! to pass whatever Bill,</p>
<p>Upstairs, seems hopeless. Tory glamour clings</p>
<p>To all high places like a darkening cloud</p>
<p>For ever. Is it your intent to 'pass'</p>
<p>(In Tennysonian sense), since your Bills won't?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And <span class="sc">Arthur</span> said: "Sir <span class="sc">Bedivere</span>, blue funk</p>
<p>Sits ill upon a knight. <span class="sc">Gawain</span> is light&mdash;</p>
<p>No one at least can say the same of <em>me!</em>"</p>
<p>(<span class="sc">Bedivere</span> murmured, "<em>No</em>, by&mdash;Behemoth!")</p>
<p>"I hear the steps of <span class="sc">Mordred</span> in the West,</p>
<p>And with him many of the people by rights,</p>
<p>And thine, whom thou hast served, ungrateful grown,</p>
<p>The idiots!&mdash;splitting up their ranks&mdash;and ours!</p>
<p>But 'pass,' in Tennysonian sense? No fear!</p>
<p>I shall arise and smash 'em as of old!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then to King <span class="sc">Arthur</span> spoke Sir <span class="sc">Bedivere</span>:</p>
<p>"Far other is this battle, our great test,</p>
<p>Whereto we move, than when great <span class="sc">Lancelot</span></p>
<p>(Now far cavorting in the snow at Cannes)</p>
<p>Thrust his great rival from St. Stephen's seats,</p>
<p>And shook him thro' the North. Ill doom is ours</p>
<p>To war against our rivals, and each other.</p>
<p>The chief who fights old followers fights himself,</p>
<p>And they, old friends who loved us once, the stroke</p>
<p>We strike at them is a back-stroke to us.</p>
<p>Nay, even the stroke of your Excalibur</p>
<p>Hath scarcely its old swashing force. Men say</p>
<p>It shall not strike again,&mdash;men whisper so!&mdash;</p>
<p>That she, the Lady of the Hibernian Lake,</p>
<p>Awaiteth its return. Ah! you unsheath it!</p>
<p>Say, must I take it&mdash;take Excalibur,</p>
<p>And fling it far into the middle mere,</p>
<p>Mark what occurs, and lightly bring you word?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then spake King <span class="sc">Arthur</span> to Sir <span class="sc">Bedivere</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>"O sombre Little-faith, miscalled the Bold!</p>
<p><em>Not if I know it!</em> 'Tis a beauteous blade&mdash;</p>
<p>Broad, and bejewelled, and but lately gript</p>
<p>By my long-waiting hand. I have it now,</p>
<p>And if indeed I cast the brand away,</p>
<p>Surely a craven donkey I shall be!</p>
<p>What good should follow this, if this were done?</p>
<p>What harm undone? By George! Sir <span class="sc">Bedivere</span>,</p>
<p>'Twixt frivolling <span class="sc">Gawain</span> and too doleful you,</p>
<p>I have a pretty pair of knightly pals,&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay, I mean palfry'd knights!&mdash;to back me up.</p>
<p>Is this the loyalty of the Table Round?</p>
<p>Were <span class="sc">Mordred</span> a worse traitor? or e'en he,</p>
<p>The Midland Knight, who pushes for my place</p>
<p>As he did for Sir <span class="sc">Lancelot's</span>? Oh, get out!</p>
<p>What should my dauntless Derby henchmen say</p>
<p>Should I, on Wednesday, show the feather white</p>
<p>And say I'd chucked the sword Excalibur</p>
<p>Away, unchallenged, in a fit of funk?</p>
<p>I lose the sword? <em>I've not yet lost the scabbard!</em></p>
<p>Nay, I shall flash it flaming in their sight,</p>
<p>And brandish it, and promise swashing blows</p>
<p>Of the keen blade, as ofttimes heretofore.</p>

<h2>THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!</h2>

<p class="center1">(<em>An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, in Three Parts.</em>)</p>

<p class="title1b"><span class="sc">Part III.</span>&mdash;<em>The Apotheosis of the Picture.</em></p>

<p>Those who have done me the distinguished honour of reading the
story of my find of a genuine <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span> (in my agitation last week
I referred erroneously to the great master as Old <span class="sc">Boots</span>) will remember
that I had got to the point where the picture I now so deeply
prized had been removed by the handy-man to be sold, no doubt, at
a crushing sacrifice. When put to it (as all my friends know) I am
a man of an iron will and a steel determination. There is no sacrifice
I will not make to carry a fixed plan into execution. It was this iron
will and steel determination that enabled me (somewhat late in life)
to conquer the apparently adamant intention of the Examiners at
Lincoln's Inn and get called to the Bar. At this crisis in my life's
history the reserve forces of my nature came to my assistance, and inspired
me to hurry without a moment's delay to the dwelling-place of
<span class="sc">Wilkins</span>.</p>

<p>Before discovering that the <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span> had been removed I had
assumed (as it is my wont after returning from Pump-Handle
Court) my slippers. Without waiting to amend my costume, without
lingering to recover my umbrella (now reclining in its stand, seemingly
exchanging confidences with my walking-stick), I started for
Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise. The lady who has
honoured me by accepting my name had furnished me with this
address&mdash;the abode of the unconsciously-fugitive <span class="sc">Wilkins</span>. Without
a moment's hesitation I hailed and entered a four-wheeler.</p>

<p>"Panorama Place, Nine Sisters Road, Rixton Rise," I said in the
tone of the late Duke of <span class="sc">Wellington</span> ordering the advance of the
Guards at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The cabman shook his head, then seemingly pondered, then looked
at me. "Is it near the 'Green Compasses'?" he asked, after a
pause of intense thought.</p>

<p>I have always considered Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> a model of sobriety. But
then I have only known him in the hours devoted to duty, to the
sweeping of kitchen chimneys, to the re-building of wash-houses,
to the re-papering of studies, to the removal of grand pianos from
basement to attic, and other little domestic offices. In his moments
of relaxation he may be a genial <em>viveur</em>, and in this character
was more likely than not to live in close proximity to the no doubt
hospitable tavern to which the driver had referred. So I answered
my Jehu that I thought it exceedingly possible that Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span>
did dwell near the "Green Compasses." We started, and after a
drive for which I was charged (and in my opinion rightly charged)
five-and-sixpence, arrived safely at Panorama Place, Nine Sisters
Road, Rixton Rise.</p>

<p>The shadow of anxiety that had followed me through what I may be
permitted to term my hackney peregrinations had passed away. I
had feared that when I had successfully tracked out Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span> to
his suburban nest I should find him flown. But no, the eagle had
not lost the child, the handy man was still the possessor of my
pictorial treasure. At least so I presumed, as he smiled when I put
to him the all-important question, "Where is my <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span>?"</p>

<p>"This is what I have done with him, Sir," said my house-renovator,
leading me gently into what I take must have been his
study. The apartment was furnished with two spades, a saw, two
hammers, a pot of glue, a model of a fire-engine, a couple of stools,
and a sideboard.</p>

<p>"Look at this little lot, Sir," cried Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkins</span>, whipping off a
cloth, and exposing to view two earthenware flower-vases, and a
small model (in chalk) of an easily illuminated (there was a receptacle
in the interior large enough to contain a taper) cathedral.</p>

<p>"What are these?" I demanded, in a voice more or less suggestive
of thunder.</p>

<p>"That's what he gave me for the picture, and, asking your
pardon, Sir, I think I have done well with him. It was one of those
Italian image-men, who took a fancy to it. He offered at first only
those vases. Then he sprang to a statuette of <span class="sc">Garibaldi</span>. But,
after a deal of discussion, I got him to chuck in Westminster
Abbey, Sir, which, as you see, can be lighted up magnificent."</p>

<p>For a moment I was struck speechless with sorrow and indignation.
No doubt the foreign hawker, having received an art education
in Italy (the renowned dwelling-place of the Muses), had
recognised the value of my picture, and had&mdash;&mdash;. I paused in my
train of thought, and jumped from despair to joy. There, resting on a
newly-renovated perambulator, was my Old Master. I almost wept
as I recognised my nearly lost <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span>.</p>

<p>"But there it is!" I hoarsely whispered, pointing to the picture.</p>

<p>"The canvas, yes Sir&mdash;the Italian chap only wanted the frame.
He called the donkey lot rubbish."</p>

<p>Again my iron will and steel determination came to the front. To
secure the canvas, charter another four-wheeler, and deposit myself
and my prize within the cab's depths was the work of not more than
five-and-twenty minutes. I drove as hurriedly as the congested
traffic would permit to the house of a well-known connoisseur. I
sent up my card, and was immediately admitted. The celebrated
critic was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

<p>"This must serve as an introduction," I said, and exposed my
<span class="sc">Von Böotz</span> to view. The connoisseur inspected the canvas, the
leaden sky, and the villagers with languid interest. At last his
gaze fell upon the presentment of the donkey. His eyes sparkled,
his cheeks flushed with excitement; and although he was evidently
attempting to master his emotion, he almost shouted "Magnificent!"</p>

<p>"Are not the ears splendid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Splendid? Glorious! Immortal!"</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything to equal the mane?"</p>

<p>"Never! Emphatically, never!"</p>

<p>And then the art connoisseur shook me by both hands. Then we
once more inspected the donkey's ears, and in our delight nearly
rose and floated from the floor in a sort of medieval saint-like
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"You see it has one fault," my conscience made me say; "it has
no signature."</p>

<p>"A proof that it is a genuine <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span>. The grand old forger
never signed anything except copies. As you know, he was scarcely
ever sober, and in his drunken moods used to write his name on any
kind of canvas at the rate of a tumbler of port a signature."</p>

<p>"And it is only right to add," I continued, in my character of
Devil's Advocate, and using a piece of information I had picked up
from <span class="sc">Appleblossom</span>, Q.C., "that it is not in the least like a print
which is supposed to be a contemporaneous engraving."</p>

<p>"The best possible proof that it is an original. Old <span class="sc">Von
Böotz</span>&mdash;glorious
old scoundrel&mdash;never painted anything that was really reproduced.
He preferred to betray his public by signing the works of
subordinates. That's the reason why he is so scarce. Oh, those
ears!"</p>

<p>And the art connoisseur and I returned to our medieval saint-like
ecstasy. I am almost certain that, carried away by our enthusiasm,
we floated from the carpet. After a while I thought it time to return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
to what the Philistine (by the way, all things considered, a very
reasonable fellow) would call "business." I suggested that it was
for sale.</p>

<p>"No, my dear Sir," corrected the critic; "not for sale. The <span class="sc">Von
Böotz</span> must be mine. You will not be so cruel as to deny me. I am
the master of tens of thousands&mdash;nay, I might say without exaggeration&mdash;hundreds
of thousands. If you will leave yourself in my
hands, I think you will find that I am a man of honour."</p>

<p>He sat down at a desk which I now noticed was made of ebony and
decorated with old gold and diamonds, and other precious stones.
He drew a cheque. Then he rose to give it to me. But as he
passed the picture it once more attracted his attention. He resumed
his medieval saint-like ecstasy for a second, and then returned to his
desk.</p>

<p>"I must be honest," he murmured as he filled in the figures of
another cheque. Then he turned to me. "You must pardon me for
giving you the purchase-money in two drafts; but my first cheque
exhausted my account at one bank, and I had to draw upon my
balance at another to supply the necessary residue."</p>

<p>I nearly fainted when I read the amounts.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said the art connoisseur as he shook me by the
hand. "Although you have, I confess, half my fortune, I am richer
than I was when I met you. The <span class="sc">Von Böotz</span>&mdash;<em>my</em> <span class="sc">Von
Böotz</span>&mdash;is
simply of priceless value."</p>

<p>And so the picture that had been sent to the box-room and narrowly
escaped the uncultured clutch of the Italian image-man, had
raised me from comparative poverty to superlative affluence. I paid
in the cheques at my bankers, and a murmur went up from the
clerks, and the manager waylaid me at the door to press my hand.
Then I drove to my favourite stores and purchased a trifle in
diamonds to present to my wife. Fortunately, I had my chequebook
with me, or otherwise my deposit account would have been overdrawn
by a thousand.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," I said to my better (from a spiritual, not a financial
point of view) seven-eights, "we will acquire the nine-hundred-ton
yacht, the best part of Norway, and the Palace at Venice. The latter
will cost a few more thousands than I care to spend. But I suppose
the foreign dukedom that comes with it in itself is almost worth the five
figures. To-morrow I must see if I cannot secure that Colonelcy of
Yeomanry. Then, if you like dear, we will take the six centre
boxes in the grand tier at Covent Garden for the season, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so happy!" almost wept the partner of my joys and
sorrows; "and to think that we should have sent the mine of all this
prosperity into the box-room!"</p>

<p>"Yes dear," I replied. "It was you, dear, who always wanted to
be free of it."</p>

<p>"I told you, sweet one," was the triumphant response, "to get
rid of it, and are you not now pleased that you took my advice?"</p>

<p>And I admitted I was.</p>

<p>The future's pageantry of personage</p>
<p>And scene was thine unique prerogative;</p>
<p>So easily thy creations take the mould</p>
<p>Of aftertimes and characters unborn.</p>
<p>Paris to-day seems Padua, thy fair shrew,</p>
<p>The tricksy termagant, "curst <em>Katharine</em>,"</p>
<p>The Paduan <em>Xantippe</em>, prickly, perverse,</p>
<p>Yet fascinating vixen, dons to-day</p>
<p>A Gallic guise, and fumes in French, and flounces</p>
<p>In skirts <em>à la République</em>.</p>
<p class="i18">                What said <em>Gremio?</em></p>

<p>"<em>What! shall I be appointed hours</em>, <em>as though, belike</em></p>

<p>There speaks the sweet-faced shrew, and takes to-day</p>
<p>What she will leave to-morrow. Yet she shines</p>
<p>In the description of <em>Hortensio</em>.</p>
<p>"<em>With wealth enough</em>, <em>and young</em>, <em>and beauteous;</em></p>
<p><em>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;</em></p>
<p><em>Her only fault (and that is faults enough)</em></p>
<p><em>Is</em>, <em>that she is intolerably curst</em>,</p>
<p><em>And shrewd</em>, <em>and froward: so beyond all measure</em>,</p>
<p><em>That</em>, <em>were my state far worser than it is</em>,</p>
<p><em>I would not wed her for a mine of gold</em>."</p>
<p>And yet there be good fellows in the world,</p>
<p>'An a man could but haply light on them,</p>
<p>Would take the veriest vixen "<em>with all faults</em>."</p>
<p>And many a one hath said, or seemed to say,</p>
<p>"<em>For I will board her</em>, <em>though she chide as loud</em></p>
<p><em>As thunder</em>, <em>when the clouds in autumn crack</em>."</p>
<p>But with what issue? Like <em>Hortensio</em>,</p>
<p>His head is broken by the vixen's lute,</p>
<p>Ere he hath time to teach her government</p>
<p>Of frets or stops, or skilful fingering.</p>
<p>How many, with <em>Hortensio</em>, might say,</p>
<p>When asked if he could break her to the lute,&mdash;</p>
<p>"<em>Why</em>, <em>no; for she hath broke the lute to me</em>.</p>
<p><em>I did but tell her</em>, <em>she mistook her frets</em>,</p>
<p><em>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;</em></p>
<p><em>When with a most impatient devilish spirit</em>,</p>
<p>'Frets, call you these?' <em>quoth she:</em> 'I'll fume with them:'</p>
<p><em>And with that word</em>, <em>she struck me on the head</em>,</p>
<p><em>And through the instrument my pate made way;</em></p>
<p><em>And there I stood amazed for a while</em>,</p>
<p><em>As on a pillory</em>, <em>looking through the lute:</em></p>
<p><em>While she did call me</em>, <em>rascal fiddler</em>,</p>
<p><em>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms</em>,</p>
<p><em>As she had studied to misuse me so</em>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Her masters have not learned true mastery,</p>
<p>And he, her latest would-be teacher, turns</p>
<p>Too prompt and pusillanimous a back</p>

<p>Quicker than buffeted <em>Hortensio</em></p>
<p>In poor, poltroonish, post-deserting flight;</p>
<p>Leaving the lute whose harmonies his hand</p>
<p>Should have bowed hers to, broken and unstrung,</p>
<p>In the shrew's angry and outrageous grasp:</p>
<p>See how the Gallic <em>Katharine</em> in her fume,</p>
<p>Flouting all mastery, flouncing uncontrolled</p>
<p>In furious anger, flings the shattered lute,</p>
<p>Unstrung, aside, as did the Paduan shrew,</p>
<p>Spurning all government&mdash;till <em>Petruchio</em> came!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"<em>Come, come you wasp; i' faith you are too angry!</em>"</p>
<p>So, in <em>Petruchio's</em> words, say France's friends.</p>
<p>Whilst foes and half-allies look doubtful on,</p>
<p>From the chill Eastward or more genial North,</p>
<p>Wondering what stable faith, in love or hate,</p>
<p>May rest upon such shifting shrewishness.</p>
<p>Where waits <em>Petruchio</em>, and will he come</p>
<p>In purple velvet, or in soldier steel,</p>
<p>Or simple, civic, hero-covering cloth,</p>
<p>To tame this <em>Katharine</em> of the Phrygian cap,</p>
<p>And smiling, in the mocking calm of power,</p>
<p>Say of the shrew, like him of Padua:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<em>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</em></p>

<p><em>Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat?</em></p>
<p><em>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field</em>,</p>
<p><em>And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?</em></p>
<p><em>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</em></p>
<p><em>Loud 'larums</em>, <em>neighing steeds</em>, <em>and trumpets' clang?</em></p>
<p><em>And do you tell me of a woman's tongue;</em></p>
<p><em>That gives not half so great a blow to th' ear</em></p>
<p><em>As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?</em></p>

<h2 class="sb">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="title1b">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (<span class="sc">CONTINUED.</span>)</p>

<p>Shortly after the great victory of the Dead Marshes, the British
Army, under the command of Sir <span class="sc">Bonamy Battlehorn</span>, took possession
of Balmuggur, the capital of the country, known far and
wide as the Diamond City of the Ranee. There was a faint show of
resistance, but after I had defeated in single combat six picked
mollahs of the Royal Guard, the disheartened garrison laid down its
arms, and the place surrendered at discretion. We had brought
<span class="sc">Hadju Thâr Meebhoy</span> with us, although, in his perforated condition,
it was a matter of some difficulty to transport him. Still it
would have been barbarous to leave him behind to the tender
mercies of the neighbouring peasantry, and we resolved to attempt
his conveyance to Balmuggur. Fortunately we succeeded beyond
our most sanguine hopes. I was able to render him some slight
services on the march, and, after the city had fallen, I paid him
daily visits, during which I conceived a sincere and lasting friendship
for the gallant fellow whose only fault, after all, had been the
notion that he could defeat one who
has never yet given way an inch
before the hottest attack even of
overwhelming numbers. It was
quite touching to see his swarthy
face brighten into a smile when I
entered the room. He looked forward
eagerly to my daily visit, and
often told me that the simple tales
of my courage and daring with
which I entertained him were of
more use to him than all the ointments
and bandages and medicines
with which dear old <span class="sc">Toby O'Grady</span>
used to treat his wound. On his
side the <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span>, too, was confidential.
Many an hour have I
spent with him listening to his
stories of court plot and palace
intrigue in Balmuggur, dark episodes
of passion and crime and
sudden death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/045-900.png"><img src="images/045-400.png" width="400" height="486" alt="'I perceived the Ranee's Chamberlain.'" /></a>
<h4>"I perceived the Ranee's Chamberlain."</h4></div>

<p>One morning I was sitting as
usual by the <span class="sc">Meebhoy's</span> bedside. I
had just related to him my adventure
with the Lord Mayor of Dublin,
whom, as readers of contemporary
journals will remember, I had been
compelled to chastise for the unpardonable
affront of calling me by
my Christian name at a public
meeting, by kicking him bodily
from end to end of the Rotunda,
breaking three chandeliers as he
spun through the air, and imprinting
the shape of his back on the
opposite wall, where it may still be
observed by the curious. This adventure,
and the story of my subsequent
escape from the dungeons
of the Dublin Mansion House, have rarely failed to extort applause
from those to whom I have narrated them. But on this occasion the
<span class="sc">Meebhoy</span> was silent and <em>distrait</em>. He lay for some time drumming
in an absent-minded way with his fingers on the front aluminium
door of his wound (the famous operation had by this time been successfully
performed), and made no comment whatever on the tale
I had related to him. Then suddenly he turned, looked me full in
the face, and addressed me. "Harkye, Sirrah," he observed, "your
story has interested me strangely; but there is that in my mind
which demands an exit. Methinks that they who hold governance
here mistake me strangely. Because I am all but corpsed, they
think they can neglect this <span class="sc">Johnny</span>. The Ranee has but once sent
a stable-helper to inquire after me. Grammercy, but such treatment
is scurvy, and I mean to show the old witch that <span class="sc">Hadju Thâr</span>
knows what's what, and, by Jingo, he's going to have it all the
time. That's so." I have forgotten, I think, to mention that my
friend had learnt his English in Seringapatam from such examples
as he could lay his hands on in that remote island, and the result
was a certain patchiness of style, which did not, however, by any
means, interfere with the vigour and fluency of his diction.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," I said, "that this slight is intentional?
Really, I cannot believe that the Ranee would willingly neglect so
gallant and devoted a servant."</p>

<p>"That shows me you little know the Queen of the Diamond City.
Why, blow me tight, she's as artful as a cartload of monkeys, and in
profundity of design and daring of execution, she'd give a man-eating
tiger two stone and a handsome beating over any course you
care to name. But I am resolved to be avenged. Never shall it be
said that the descendant of a thousand kings had the comether put on
him by a cinder-faced old omadhaun like that. See here now," he
continued, drawing me closer to him, while he glanced furtively
round and sank his voice to a whisper, "it's yourself I'm talking to.
Hast heard of the Pink Hippopotamus?"</p>

<p>"What!" I replied; "the sacred animal of the Seringapatamese,
the dweller in the inaccessible mountain fastness of Jam Tirnova, the
deathless guardian of the royal race of this island?"</p>

<p>"The same," he answered calmly; "no mortal foot, save those of
his priests, has ever yet approached him. The perils are manifold,
the attempt is well nigh desperate, but you're not the game chicken
I take you for if you don't accomplish his capture and discomfit the
haughty Ranee. Crikey, but I'd like to hear the old gal squeal
when they tell her her bloomin' hippo's got took. Blime if I
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"But how shall I set about it, what steps ought I to take?"</p>

<p>"Is it steps you mane? What in thunder is the man wanting? Here,
boy, take these papers. I have set
down in them clearly how the
matter may best be undertaken.
Peruse them and learn them well.
If you have resource, courage and
prudence, within a week the prize
shall be yours, and the insult offered
to me shall be expiated."</p>

<p>With that he pressed a bundle of
papers into my hand, and bade me
leave him.</p>

<p>As I left the tent I heard a
scuffling of feet. I darted in the
direction in which I thought they
had gone, and there sure enough,
running as if he wanted to break
a hundred yards record, I perceived
the Ranee's Chamberlain. I
set off after him, nothing loth to
give an example of my speed. Besides,
if the old fellow had overheard
us our doom was sealed; it
was necessary to capture and silence
him. In ten strides I was close up
to him. In another moment I was
near enough to seize him. I stretched
out my hand to do so, when suddenly
he gave two short yells,
turned round in a swift pirouette,
and, before I had realised what
had happened, landed me a tremendous
kick full on the chest.
The force of the blow was terrible,
and only my iron bones could have
withstood it. Seeing that I still
advanced he made at me again.
This time, however, I was too
quick for him. I seized him by his
uplifted ankle, and, regardless of
his appeal for mercy, whirled him
three times round my head and flung him from me. His shoe remained
in my hand, but beyond that no trace of the miserable Chamberlain
has ever been discovered. He simply vanished from human knowledge
as completely as though his body had been resolved into its elements.
It is true that Professor <span class="sc">Spooks</span> of the University of Caffraria
declared that a new meteor had on that very day appeared in South
Africa travelling eastwards. His discovery was scoffed at by the
scientific, but for my own part I have sometimes thought that, with a
telescope of sufficient power, the learned Professor might have been
able to establish an identity between his supposed comet and the lost
Chamberlain of the Ranee.</p>

<p>Having thus dispatched my foe, I returned to my own quarters to
study the papers of the <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span>.</p>

<p>As I entered my room a terrible sight met my eyes.</p>

<h3>A RENCONTRE.</h3>

<h4>(<em>For investigation by the Psychical Society.</em>)</h4>

<div class="poem width25">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The way was long, the train was slow,</p>
<p>As local trains are wont to go,</p>
<p>A feeble ray of glimmering light</p>
<p>Strove vainly with the darkling night,</p>
<p>And scarce enabled me to see</p>
<p>The features of my <em>vis-à-vis</em>.</p>
<p>Pale was his brow: no paler grow</p>
<p>The snowdrops lurking in the snow;</p>
<p>Hollow his cheeks, and sunk his eyes</p>
<p>That gazed on me in mournful wise.</p>
<p>So strange a man I ne'er had seen,</p>
<p>So wan a look, so weird a mien,</p>
<p>And, as I eyed him, I confess</p>
<p>A feeling of uncanniness</p>
<p>Crept slowly over me and stole</p>
<p>Into the marrow of my soul.</p>
<p class="i2">Awhile we sped, nor spake a word;</p>
<p>Nought but the droning wheels was heard;</p>
<p>But as we journeyed on together,</p>
<p class="i2">By tentative degrees we fell</p>
<p>From observations on the weather</p>
<p class="i2">To talk of other things as well.</p>
<p>"I had a few hours off," said he;</p>
<p>"So I just ran across to see</p>
<p>The last inventions&mdash;&mdash;I refer</p>
<p>To Kensington Museum, Sir.</p>
<p>You know it? What a grand display!</p>
<p>A splendid exhibition, eh?</p>
<p>I never saw so fine a show</p>
<p>Of coffins anywhere, you know!</p>
<p>And there is one that's simply sweet,</p>
<p>With handles, knobs, and plate complete!"</p>
<p>"A coffin!"&mdash;Cold a shudder ran</p>
<p>Adown me as I eyed the man.</p>
<p>"Aye, to be sure. What else?" he said.</p>
<p>"The one that's just been patented.</p>
<p>Why, my good Sir, I will engage</p>
<p>It is the marvel of the age;</p>
<p>For, mark you, they no longer use</p>
<p>Your clumsy, antiquated screws,</p>
<p>But just a simple catch and pin</p>
<p>That may be managed <em>from within!</em>"</p>
<p class="i2">He ceased, for we had reached a station</p>
<p>That chanced to be his destination.</p>
<p>"My home!" he murmured, with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Home&mdash;home! Sweet home!&mdash;Good-night!&mdash;Good-bye!"</p>
<p>"Good-night!" I answered; and my heart</p>
<p>Leaped when I saw his form depart.</p>
<p>But as we slowly glided past</p>
<p>The spot where I had seen him last,</p>
<p>Upon the station lamps, methought,</p>
<p>The letters of a name I caught.</p>
<p>I looked again.&mdash;My hair uprose,</p>
<p>The very soul within me froze,</p>
<p>For lo! upon the lamps was seen</p>
<p>The curdling legend&mdash;<span class="sc">Kensal Green</span>!</p>

floor is perfect for

the latter not to be charged full
price, but admitted on a sliding
scale. Nice to see Mr. <span class="sc">Edward

the band, cuts a very pretty
figure. Dangerous, though, to
the real ice, to have "Sol" so
close to it; that is, if there could
be "melting moments."</p>

<h3>THE LAUREATE SOCIETY.</h3>

<p>The annual general meeting of the Amalgamated British Society
for the Supply of Laureates to the public was held yesterday. There
was a numerous attendance of authors and reviewers with a sprinkling
of publishers. Mr. <span class="sc">Grant Allen</span> was moved to the chair. The
Chairman in presenting the report of the Directors regretted that he
was unable to congratulate the Society on having accomplished the
primary object of its existence, the filling up of the vacant laureateship.
He himself, he said, had done his best. He had discovered a
new sun in the firmament of poetry at least once a month, and had
never hesitated to publish the name of his selection in one of the reviews.
He was still willing to take seven to four about Mr. <span class="sc">John
Davidson</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Francis Thompson</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">William Watson</span>
barred. The balance-sheet of the Society did not show a very
flourishing state of affairs. As assets they could enter fifteen
sonnets, twelve irregularly rhymed odes (one by Mr. <span class="sc">Richard le
Gallienne</span>), twenty-four volumes of a strictly limited edition issued
from the Bodley Head, four tons of the Yellow Book, and an unpublished
selection of manuscript poems written by a victim to <em>delirium
tremens</em> whose name he was not at liberty to mention. On the other
side, however, they had to face the fact that their expenses had been
heavy. It was becoming more and more costly and difficult to feed
the public on geniuses, and he was inclined to advise the discontinuance
of this branch of the Society's operations.</p>

<p>At this point some commotion was caused by Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span>
and Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Waugh</span>, who rose simultaneously to protest against
the Chairman's remarks. Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span> was so far carried
away by his agitation as to hurl a pamphlet at Mr. <span class="sc">Grant Allen's</span>
head. In the uproar which ensued, Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span> could be
heard ejaculating "beautiful phrases," "richly-coloured musical
sentences," "ideal and transcendental," "nothing finer since <span class="sc">Lamb</span>,"
"all for eighteenpence," and "a genius who sleeps below the wood-pigeons."
The pamphlet thus discharged proved to be by a Mr.
<span class="sc">John Eglinton</span>, and Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span> was removed in the
custody of a police-inspector, who was described by Mr. <span class="sc">Waugh</span> as a
Philistine.</p>

<p>When calm had been restored, Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred Austin</span> asked where
he came in. He had never allowed a birth, a wedding, or a death
in the upper circles of Royalty to pass unsung; and though he had
been a constant subscriber to the Society it didn't seem to have done
him any good. Besides, he had discovered Ireland last year. Mr.
<span class="sc">Lewis Morris</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Eric Mackay</span> made similar complaints.
The latter offered to write patriotic poems with plenty of rhymes in
them against any other living man. Would the meeting allow him
to recite&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>At this point the Chairman interposed, and said that the Directors
had decided against recitations&mdash;a statement which provoked loud
murmurs of dissatisfaction. Eventually, Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span> (who
had returned, disguised in proof-sheets), proposed a vote of thanks
to Mr. <span class="sc">John Davidson</span>, who proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. <span class="sc">Grant
Allen</span>, who proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. <span class="sc">Francis Thompson</span>,
who proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Waugh</span>, who proposed
a vote of thanks to Mr. <span class="sc">John Lane</span>, who proposed a vote of
thanks to Mr. <span class="sc">Le Gallienne</span>. All these having been unanimously
passed, the meeting broke up.</p>

<p class="ind">QUEER QUERIES.&mdash;<span class="sc">War of Words.</span>&mdash;<em>À propos</em> of Mr.
<span class="sc">Plowden's</span>
decision in the "Flannelette case," can that worthy magistrate
have foreseen some of its effects? For instance, wanting to buy a
sideboard, I went to a furniture-dealer's, and saw one, apparently
made of the best mahogany, which took my fancy greatly. I casually
asked of what wood it was composed and was astonished to have
the answer given me, "Mahoganette," by the shop-walker. So I
walked out of the shop. When I <em>want</em> painted deal I can inquire
for that article. Again, I have noticed during the last few days a
great falling-off in my butter (though not in its price). On my
remonstrating, the seller frankly admitted that the article was
"butterette," not butter. "What does 'ette' mean?" I asked
him. He said it meant "little," adding, with a wink, that I should
find "precious little butter, too." And this was the case. What
<em>are</em> we coming to?&mdash;<span class="sc">Indignant.</span></p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>The anonymous author of <em>"Spot," an Autobiography</em>
(<span class="sc">Houlston and Sons</span>, Paternoster
Square), whoever he may be, has a remarkable
insight into dog-nature, so far, that
is, as one who is not a dog, but a mere lover
of dogs, can judge. <em>Spot</em> tells his own story
in a straightforward, honest, doggy style,
which must commend him at once to the
hearts of his readers. His reflections, from
the canine point of view, are admirably just.
He never cared for flowers. "How vapid,"
he says, "is the scent of a rose, for instance,
compared with that of an old seasoned
bone." The force of the remark must be
appreciated by anyone who has watched a dog
exhuming with furtive labour a bone he had
buried a week before. A firm foe to cats, he
yet makes an exception in favour of his
house-cat, as all civilised cat-destroying dogs
do. The bull-dog's greeting to him is, in
itself, a revelation of character. "Cheer up,
youngster! Any good smells hereabouts?"
says that redoubtable animal; whereupon
they saunter together round by the back of
the house, "passing few smells of any importance
until we arrived at the ashpit."
But I cannot here quote at greater length
from his wise remarks. I can honestly advise
all lovers of dogs (boys especially) to read this
wholesome, pleasant, clever little book.</p>

<h2>VIEWING A HARE.</h2>

<h4>(<em>And the Prospect of a Good Run</em>.)</h4>

<p>The Dramatic Arthurs Society is having
a nice time of it just now with <span class="sc">Arthur
Pinero</span>, <span class="sc">Arthur Jones</span>, <span class="sc">Arthur Law</span>,
<span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span>, <em>King Arthur</em>, at the
Lyceum, and <span class="sc">Arthur à Becket</span> at the
Garrick Theatre, where <em>Faded Flowers</em>,
revived, are once again blooming. It is a
pretty piece, well played by Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Bourchier</span>&mdash;<em>encore un Arthur</em>&mdash;and Mrs.
<span class="sc">Bourchier</span>, known to the public as Miss
<span class="sc">Violet Vanbrugh</span>. A little <span class="sc">Terry</span> boy, aged
nine, is in it, and Mr. <span class="sc">Buist</span> does his very
Buist, or best. The occasion of the revival
was the resuscitation of <em>A Pair of Spectacles</em>,
in which Mr. <span class="sc">John Hare</span> is better than ever;
and, indeed, he has made it one of his very
best eccentric comedy parts. Again Mr.
<span class="sc">Groves</span> delights us with his hardwareish impersonation
of "the man from Sheffield," a
very happy thought on the part of the
author-adapter, Mr. <span class="sc">Grundy</span>.</p>

<p>The occasion of the revival, too, was also
noteworthy as being the <em>début</em> of another of
the <span class="sc">Terry</span> family, the <em>ingénue</em> of the comedy
being played by Miss <span class="sc">Mabel Terry Lewis</span>,
who certainly inherits no small share of the
<span class="sc">Terry</span> Talent. Mr. <span class="sc">Gerald du Maurier</span>, too,
is excellent in a marvellously made-up small
character part; and <span class="sc">Bertie Hare</span>&mdash;the heir
of <span class="sc">Hare</span>&mdash;is very good as the youngster. Mr.
<span class="sc">Hare</span> has fitted on this "pair of spectacles"
just in time; not to have done so would have
been shortsighted policy; and through them
no doubt he sees his way to a long and highly
satisfactory run. These two revivals Mr.
<span class="sc">Hare</span> may consider not as "a pair of specs,"
but as "a couple of certainties."</p>
